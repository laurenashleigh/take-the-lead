                <p className="class-description">For new beginners to Ballroom and Latin the children will learn the basics relevant to their age group and abilities working from the appropriate IDTA syllabus recommended steps. Exams will be taken in a variety of dances to recognise the achievements of the children and to improve confidence. Fun dances and group dances are also part of what we do in order to practice technique, warm up and work together. <br />The next level dancers will work on further and more interesting steps, technique and dances to improve their dancing and enable them to work their way through the exam levels. </p>

                <h4 className="class-title" id="sequence">Sequence</h4>
                <p className="class-description">In these classes we learn Sequence dances in a number of different styles from the most popular to the latest ones created.  Sequence dances are set routines that repeat every 16 bars of music and that everyone dances in the same direction around the floor.  They are popular as each partner learns their own set steps and so there is no freestyling element to worry about.</p>
